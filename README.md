# Doodlebyrd

Doodlebyrd is a fun project that I've created for my birding hobby!

## Features

My personal birding wishlist: a cute application that includes a visual 'lifer log' for logging when and where I first see a bird that includes
my own doodles (drawings) of the bird seen. A story-telling aspect that connects the user with their 'commonly-spotted' birds in a way like never before. Data and
information using APIs. Fun facts, migratory info, your location's bird hotspots, and more.
